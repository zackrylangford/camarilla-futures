## Trading Recap - Tuesday, June 4, 2024

### Overview

**Total P/L**: +$273.80


### Trade 1: MCG (Micro GOLD)
- **Position**: Long (5 contracts)
- **Entry**: 2347.70 (Above S4)
- **Original Stop**: 2343.70 (Break of LOD)
- **Exit 1**: 2352.00 (Sold 3)
- **Exit 2**: 2356.70 (Sold 1 on pop towards VWAP)
- **Exit 3**: 2353.70 (Sold 1 on breakdown of 5 minute candle)


- **Result**: +$273.80

**Notes**: Woke up and saw this trading around the S4 level and was holding it pretty well. Was a little early on the entry, could have waiting for a bit more volume and confirmation, as it was looking like it might continue to sell off. However, as markets opened up around 7:30-9a we got buyers in and popped back up to VWAP and S3. Brought stop losses up to trail as it looked like it was going to retest the lows and S4 again.
