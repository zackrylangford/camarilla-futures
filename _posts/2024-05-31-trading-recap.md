### Overview
Gold really played well off of the Camarilla points today. Just needed to be a little more patient. Here is a 5 minute chart with my levels:

Took four trades today. Here's a detailed breakdown:

**Total P/L**: +$449

### Trade 1: MGC (Micro Gold)
- **Position**: Short (3 contracts)
- **Entry**: 2375.10 (Above R3)
- **Original Stop**: 2381.30
- **Exit**: 2381.30
- **Result**: ($-51)

**Notes**: Anticipated a move below R3 and went short. Moved my stop loss to slightly above breakeven but got stopped out on a pop after the open. Should have waited for confirmation.
