I think the biggest challenge that I have faced with trading, and I think many others can say the same is the challenge of controlling one's emotions while trading. 

The market is not rational in a way that can be predicted with 100 percent accuracy. I mean, even having a better than 50 percent win rate over a consistent period of time is great. 

The key is having a system that you are able to stick to when you are trading, so that you are making your decisions on that system over your emotions. 

For someone who is more of an intuitive/feeler type personality, this is incredibly hard. I have the tendency to make decisions based more on a "gut" feeling instead of my logic and head. This causes me a lot of problems if I don't have it in check. I will take trades that I shouldn't take and I will revenge trade and make poor decisions with risk management, choosing to make high risk/low reward trades that often lead to losing trades and losing days. 

I know there are tons of tips and tricks to combat this, but I have found that it is really hard to implement those rules when you are trading. For instance, the idea that you should walk away and take a break after losing a trade is hard when you feel like the trade you took is correct or is working out after hitting your stop loss. 

I have a really hard time with a red day. I hate stopping my trading when I have a losing day. Especially early in the morning. I have rules that I try to stick to, but my emotions often overwhelm me when I actually have to have the self-discipline to implement them. 

I think the key for me in this attempt has been that I am developing a playbook and strategy that is guiding my trades. I am not even focusing on creating rules to control my emotions. I guess my rule would be that I am doing my best to take trades only out of my playbook and allowing that to guide my trading. 

Also, I do have a max win amount as well as a max loss amount that shuts my account if I hit either one. That is completely out of my hands though, so that is good.
