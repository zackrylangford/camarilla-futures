## Trading Recap - Wednesday, June 5, 2024

### Overview

Took my first trade on MGC (Micro Gold) as volume came in around R3. Looked like it was struggling at this level so I went short with a stop above R3. Was able to get a decent entry but buyers came in and pushed it above R3. I moved my stop up as it looked pretty clear that it was going to grind higher. Took my second trade on MNQ (Micro Nasdaq). I hate trading this thing and I don't want to anymore. My trade looks really good, then really bad, then really good, and back and forth. Shorted at R4 when it was facing a lot of selling pressure, but it popped up and wicked me out. 


**Total P/L**: -$148.16


### Trade 1: MCG (Micro GOLD)
- **Position**: Short (4 contracts)
- **Entry**: 2355.90 (Slightly below R3)
- **Original Stop**: 2360.50 (Break of long wicked high)
- **Adjusted Stop**: 2359.50 (Brought my stop down to limit loss)
- **Exit 1**: 2359.50 (Covered 4, stop loss triggered)


- **Result**: -$148.16

**Notes**: As tough as it is to take a loss, looking back at the one minute it wasn't a terrible trade. I think I need to still be a bit more patient and really analyze the volume maybe, but it really looked like it was struggling and I got a pretty good entry. I did a limit sell order and waited to get filled, which helped me limit risk and take a slightly larger position. It could have easily sold off and would have been a green trade, but buyers came in and pushed it up. Looks like an overall bullish day so it might not be a good day to short. Also, I should probably pay more attention to the timing of my trades. This was earlier in the morning when volume is not as predictable, so that could have played into what I was seeing.

### Trade 1: MNQ (Micro Nasdaq)
- **Position**: Short (2 contracts)
- **Entry**: 18,827.75 (Slightly below R4)
- **Original Stop**: 18,857.50 (Break of HOD)
- **Exit 1**: 18,857.50 (Covered 2, stop loss triggered)


- **Result**: -$119.48

**Notes**: Again, this wasn't a terrible trade attempt. From the charts it looks like a decent place to go short. I think the challenge is that this is the selling climax zone potentially, and I should have waited a bit longer before going short. Looks like it is continuing to go nuts up and down with lots of selling and buying and long wicks. Not a good time to take an entry again. This happened on both my trades so far this morning. Will look to be more patient coming up. If my next trade is a loser I will have to close out for the day.
